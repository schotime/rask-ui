features:
  - title: Use the language
    details: Use the full power of JavaScript to describe your dynamic UI. No special primitives or magical templating language.

  - title: Reactive state

::: warning FEEDBACK WANTED
RASK has concluded its core implementation including the **Inferno-based reconciler**, **JSX transformation plugin**, and **reactive primitives**. The library is feature-complete and considered ready for release.

[**Share your feedback by creating an issue**](https://github.com/christianalfoni/rask/issues/new) - your input will help shape the final release.
:::

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { createState, render } from "rask-ui";

function Counter() {
  // Setup scope (runs once)
  const state = createState({ count: 0 });

  // Returns render scope (runs on reactive changes)
  return () => (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {state.count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => state.count++}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => state.count--}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

render(<Counter />, document.getElementById("app")!);
```

## Key Features

- **Observable State**: Create reactive state with `createState()`
- **Computed Values**: Derive state with `createComputed()`
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: `createMountEffect()`, `createCleanup()`
- **Context API**: Share state without prop drilling
- **Async Operations**: Built-in `createTask()` for optimal UI consumption
- **Error Boundaries**: Catch and handle errors gracefully
- **Automatic Batching**: State updates batched automatically
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type inference and safety

## Installation

```bash
npm create rask-ui
```
