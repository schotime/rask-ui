## Quick Example

```tsx
import { createState, render } from "rask-ui";

function Counter() {
  const state = createState({ count: 0 });

  return () => (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {state.count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => state.count++}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => state.count--}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

render(<Counter />, document.getElementById("app")!);
```

## Key Features

- **Observable State**: Create reactive state with `createState()`
- **Computed Values**: Derive state with `createComputed()`
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: `createMountEffect()`, `createCleanup()`
- **Context API**: Share state without prop drilling
- **Async Data**: Built-in `createAsync()`, `createQuery()`, `createMutation()`
- **Error Boundaries**: Catch and handle errors gracefully
- **Automatic Batching**: State updates batched automatically
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type inference and safety
